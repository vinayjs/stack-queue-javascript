Stack and Queue- Data Structures
## stack
The stack data structure is a linear data structure that accompanies a principle known as LIFO (Last In First Out) or FILO (First In Last Out).

## queue

A queue is defined as a linear data structure that is open at both ends and the operations are performed in First In First Out (FIFO) order. We define a queue to be a list in which all additions to the list are made at one end,
and all deletions from the list are made at the other end.
